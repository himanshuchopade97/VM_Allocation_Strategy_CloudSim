====== VM SCHEDULING STRATEGY COMPARISON REPORT ======

RUNTIME COMPARISON:
- Time-Shared Simulation Runtime: 0.167 seconds
- Space-Shared Simulation Runtime: 0.008 seconds
- Runtime Difference: 0.159 seconds
- Faster Strategy: Space-Shared

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Time-Shared Makespan: 200.1
- Space-Shared Makespan: 200.1
- Makespan Difference: 0.0
- Better Makespan: Space-Shared

- Time-Shared Average Execution Time: 200.0
- Space-Shared Average Execution Time: 40.0
- Average Execution Time Difference: 160.0
- Better Average Execution Time: Space-Shared

CONCLUSION:
Based on the simulation results, the Space-Shared VM scheduling strategy performs better for overall completion time (makespan).

The Space-Shared strategy performs better for average cloudlet execution time.

RECOMMENDATION:
Choose scheduling strategy based on priority:
- Use Time-Shared if average execution time is more important.
- Use Space-Shared if overall completion time (makespan) is more important.
